# Kickstarting-with-Excel
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of the project was the get familiar with many different functions on Excel. We used these functions to make calculations and analyze our data.

## Analysis and Challenges
### From the analysis of outcomes based on launch date where parent category was theater,we could see that see that we have the most successful outcomes compared to failed and canceled. We could also see that there was a peak of successful cases in May.

### From the analysis of outcomes based on goals, we populated the number of succes, failed, and canceled for each goal amount where the subcategory was plays. Firstly, we came to conclusion that we didn't have any results for canceled.

### Some of the challenges encountered while doing the project was creating the pivot tables. If I have a specific column selected by accident and wanted to create a pivot table on all of the data, it will only create the pivot table based on the columns selected. I had to make sure that no specific column was selected. Another problem I encountered was with using the COUNTIFS. I copied the formula for sucessful, failed, and canceled. But I realized something was wrong and I was getting an error. I had to freeze column F (goal). 

## Results

- The first conclutions I can draw from the outcomes based on launch date is that there were a lot more sucessful outcomes than failed and canceled combined. Another conclusion I can make is there was a spike in succesful cases in May and June

- The first conclutions I can make from outcomes based on goals is there weren't any failed projects. We could also see that in some months, number of failed were higher than number of successful, but in other months it was the other way around.

- Some limitations this dataset had was we had to use calculations to convert the dates and extract the years. We also had to use calculations to split up the parent and sub category.

- Some other graphs we could created might be stacked bar chart. So for each month, we can easily see what percentage were successful, canceled, or failed.
