# Kickstarting-with-Excel
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of the project was the get familiar with many different functions on Excel. We used these functions to make calculations and analyze our data.

## Analysis and Challenges
### From the analysis of outcomes based on launch date where parent category was theater,we could see that see that we have the most successful outcomes compared to failed and canceled. We could also see that there was a peak of successful cases in May.

### From the analysis of outcomes based on goals, we populated the number of succes, failed, and canceled for each goal amount where the subcategory was plays. Firstly, we came to conclusion that we didn't have any results for canceled. 

### Some of the challenges encountered while doing the project was creating the pivot tables. If I have a specific column selected by accident and wanted to create a pivot table on all of the data, it will only create the pivot table based on the columns selected. I had to make sure that no specific column was selected. Another problem I encountered was with using the COUNTIFS. I copied the formula for sucessful, failed, and canceled. But I realized something was wrong and I was getting an error. I had to freeze column F (goal). 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
